# Acceptance into Hack Reactor

So I guess I will be another blogger than writes about his acceptance to the Hack Reactor program. So I just received the news this morning and I can’t wait to start the program. I still have to figure out the financials but hopefully there are no road blocks there. 

What I did find interesting is that if you did the Hack Reactor Prep and did not get accepted after the first interview but got accepted in the second interview then you still can have the fees that you paid for prep go into the program. I thought that was neat given that I failed the first interview and had to wait a month before I re-interviewed. Also, they ask you do submit a project the second time around. My project was to rebuilt the connect four game. 

Another note is that each part of the Hack Reactor program is different, so you can technically apply for the online, onsite, and maker square and not wait a month. At least that is what my interviewer said. I would ask admissions and follow up on this if you are interested.

And so I will mention some tips for the interview.
1. The interviewer is your friend. At least that is how you need to think about it when you are taking the interview. He is not there to criticize but to help you. He/she is a resource that can clarify the question. 
2. If you don’t understand the question ask for clarification. Although most of the questions are pretty standard in terms of higher order function, the way they are worded can be confusing when you are under pressure. 
3. Practice, but of course you know that. But practice taking interviews and explaining it to someone. I wish I did this more. I really does help to explain the problem to someone. Although the stress conditions might now be the same, at least it is a level up from you doing it alone. 

I am excited to see how much I learn from this program. I was going to learn on my own regardless but I think the value they provide in accelerating your progress is worth the price. I will give an honest review after I start the program so stay tuned.
