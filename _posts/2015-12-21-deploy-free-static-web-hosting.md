## Free Static Website Hosting
![divshow](http://i67.tinypic.com/500cua.png)

It is sad to see the end of Divshot. It was such an easy way to host free static web pages. Although static web pages are not that interesting from a programmers point of view. They still make up a great deal of the web pages that are on the web. Every small business needs a simple static website. Sometimes they are even great for blogs. 

Fear not, Surge to the rescue!

I love free things. So naturally I came to love how easy surge is. It is so easy to use. You can deploy in minutes. 

I was curious of what it would take to build a similar website. So I tried to google the tech stack but came out empty. So I did the next best thing. I googled divshot and found the technology they used to build it. Obviously, I don't know the details of the code but it would be a really cool project to build a similar site.

Seems like they are using a familiar tech stack. It would be interesting to see how they are combining ruby and angular. I don't want to sound like a commercial, of which I haven't seen in a long time, but it's great when services are free.
